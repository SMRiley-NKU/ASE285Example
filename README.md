May have to use a plug in like CORS Everywhere (on firefox) to have the application run correctly.

Some buttons like the delete buttons do not opperate properly.

The reason I had to break away from my team and opperate solo was I had a family member involved in a gun accident that very possibly could have resulted in the loss of that family member.
I did not want this incedent to affect my team so I made the decision to opperate on my own.

This project involved a lot of research on the web to get everything working to the point that it is. 
I hope you will appreciate the effort that I put in to get the pages to respond the way the do now. 

Thank you for the course Professor, I hope to see you again for higher level courses in the near future.
